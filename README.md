# py bank
For the bank data set I counted the total number of months in the dataset. I also found the net profit/loss over the entire period and the average change in proits. Lastly, I found the months in which the greatest increase and decrease occurred. 

Another thing I could do with my analysis is compare net revenue or average change in profits for a particular year. I could also compare changes of profits for each month to see when the bank is more likely to gain or lose money. I could use these findings to make predictions and help the bank make wise financial decisions.

To run this file, download the repository and then use git bash in the pybank folder to run the main.py file inside it. Inside the PyBank folder there are two additional folders. The Resources folder contains the csv file with the bank data. The analysis folder contains a txt file containing my code's output. 


# py poll
For the poll data set I found the total number of votes casted and how many votes each candidate recieved. From this data I was able to find what percent of total votes each candidate recieved as well as who won the election. The files main.py and pandas_main.py both accomplish these tasks, one was done without pandas and the other one with. 

Another thing we could have done is find how how many votes each candidate recieved in each county. This data could be helpful to the candidates in a future election so they can see what counties they need to invest more time campaigning in. If we had a map we could also create a map showing where candidates were the most popular and do some additional analysis on the populations there. 

To run this file, download the repository and then use git bash in the PyPoll folder and run either main.py or pandas_main.py. Inside the PyPoll folder there are two additional folders. The Resources folder contains the csv file with our raw election data. The analysis folder contains two text documents containing each .py files' outputs.
